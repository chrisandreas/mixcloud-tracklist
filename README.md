# Mixcloud Tracklist & Downloads browser extension

This is an *unofficial* Mixcloud browser extension. It displays the tracklist
the same way it did before they changed their [licensing][mc-support]. Track list is also
intractive, you can click on track to jump to that track in media player.

Extension was originaly developed by [Andrew Lawson][originalgit]. 

It supports the new Mixcloud website, having come out of beta in January 2017.

# Didn't this used to exist?
Yep, it used to be built into the Mixcloud website, but their licensing changed meaning they couldn't show the tracklist.

> As a non-interactive streaming service, our licenses don't allow for
> tracklists to be made visible in advance. However as you listen through a
> show or DJ mix set, the track names will be revealed.
